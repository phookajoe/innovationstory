1
00:0:01,000 --> 00:0:04,000
the strategic innovation group is really structured

2
00:0:04,000 --> 00:0:08,000  
in order to provide can create new value for our clients

3
00:0:08,000 --> 00:0:12,000  
a lot of people say well what exactly do you mean by that

4
00:0:12,000 --> 00:0:12,000  
when you think about where we are at this point in history

5
00:0:14,000 --> 00:0:18,000  
the budgets across all of government

6
00:0:18,000 --> 00:0:18,000  
and even our commercial clients are declining operational budgets to perform

7
00:0:22,000 --> 00:0:22,000  
their mission

8
00:0:23,000 --> 00:0:27,000  
or to accomplish their business objectives and yet

9
00:0:27,000 --> 00:0:30,000  
when you think about it the requirements

10
00:0:30,000 --> 00:0:35,000  
the expectations and those missions and businesses have not changed

11
00:0:35,000 --> 00:0:42,000  
anyway and so our clients across the board are really looking for ways to

12
00:0:42,000 --> 00:0:44,000  
create new value

13
00:0:44,000 --> 00:0:50,000  
from ideas from innovations from new capabilities put together in new ways

14
00:0:50,000 --> 00:0:55,000  
that's really what this strategic Innovation Group Inc who's now on

15
00:0:55,000 --> 00:0:58,000  
is focused on providing for our clients

16
00:0:58,000 --> 00:1:04,000  
by bringing capabilities and innovations together in new and unique ways

17
00:1:04,000 --> 00:1:09,000  
in some cases their old ideas put together in new ways

18
00:1:09,000 --> 00:1:12,000  
in some cases their new ideas but in

19
00:1:12,000 --> 00:1:12,000  
either dimension and we're looking at ways to bring those ideas to create

20
00:1:17,000 --> 00:1:21,000  
solutions that help our clients solve their most challenging problems

21
00:1:21,000 --> 00:1:26,000  
and the reality years with less money to spend they need those product they need

22
00:1:26,000 --> 00:1:26,000  
those

23
00:1:26,000 --> 00:1:32,000  
problem solved in a more efficient way than ever before

24
00:1:32,000 --> 00:1:38,000  
so when you think about declining budgets and yet increasing expectations

25
00:1:38,000 --> 00:1:39,000  
for mission in business

26
00:1:39,000 --> 00:1:44,000  
there's a gap between what our clients can afford

27
00:1:44,000 --> 00:1:48,000  
and what they need and we're calling Matt the value gap

28
00:1:48,000 --> 00:1:51,000  
and from the value gap what we're trying to do

29
00:1:51,000 --> 00:1:56,000  
is create new solutions for our clients that are less expensive

30
00:1:56,000 --> 00:2:03,000  
access existing or new emerging take not technologies and combine them with

31
00:2:03,000 --> 00:2:06,000  
existing capabilities to provide

32
00:2:06,000 --> 00:2:10,000  
better solutions than what they've had previously so hopefully we're creating

33
00:2:10,000 --> 00:2:14,000  
new value for our clients by doing that

34
00:2:14,000 --> 00:2:19,000  
our capabilities are combined in unique ways

35
00:2:19,000 --> 00:2:23,000  
we have structured our innovation agenda very purposefully

36
00:2:23,000 --> 00:2:28,000  
along are clients most challenging and pressing problems

37
00:2:28,000 --> 00:2:32,000  
me give you an example in a few of those all of our clients

38
00:2:32,000 --> 00:2:36,000  
are suffering from an inundation I have data

39
00:2:36,000 --> 00:2:40,000  
but they don't have to manage it they don't really know what data they have

40
00:2:40,000 --> 00:2:44,000  
they don't have stored and most importantly they don't have to get value

40
00:2:44,000 --> 00:2:45,000  
from it

41
00:2:45,000 --> 00:2:50,000  
SAR Bali from data initiative is specifically focused on developing

42
00:2:50,000 --> 00:2:52,000  
products and services for clients

43
00:2:52,000 --> 00:2:56,000  
they can leverage their latent data across their institution

44
00:2:56,000 --> 00:3:00,000  
to better manage their institution or their firms other business

45
00:3:00,000 --> 00:3:03,000  
but most importantly also to generate value from that data

46
00:3:03,000 --> 00:3:07,000  
in it in no way of products and services

47
00:3:07,000 --> 00:3:12,000  
we're also working on a big client problem around being able to predict

48
00:3:12,000 --> 00:3:16,000  
threats whether it's insider threats are global threats

49
00:3:16,000 --> 00:3:19,000  
to commercial businesses or to our government clients

50
00:3:19,000 --> 00:3:23,000  
in in touch today

51
00:3:23,000 --> 00:3:28,000  
what we see is clients being able to

52
00:3:28,000 --> 00:3:32,000  
react to threats but not necessarily be able to predict

53
00:3:32,000 --> 00:3:35,000  
when and where and how they might occur

54
00:3:35,000 --> 00:3:39,000  
are foresight capabilities

55
00:3:39,000 --> 00:3:43,000  
global foresight cyber force I'd and insider foresight

56
00:3:43,000 --> 00:3:49,000  
are specific capabilities and solutions that we've tailored from our years of

57
00:3:49,000 --> 00:3:51,000  
working with the intelligence community

58
00:3:51,000 --> 00:3:56,000  
to help commercial clients and other government clients better predict where

59
00:3:56,000 --> 00:3:57,000  
those threats might happen

60
00:3:57,000 --> 00:4:01,000  
our clients across the board have massive

61
00:4:01,000 --> 00:4:06,000  
numbers systems many redundant many outdated

62
00:4:06,000 --> 00:4:10,000  
interfacing modernization challenges that are facing

63
00:4:10,000 --> 00:4:14,000  
inherent use challenges across their

64
00:4:14,000 --> 00:4:17,000  
organization as well as

65
00:4:17,000 --> 00:4:21,000  
issues with regard to their effectiveness in supporting the mission

66
00:4:21,000 --> 00:4:26,000  
our mission solutions initiative is focused

67
00:4:26,000 --> 00:4:31,000  
vary purposefully on helping our clients solve their enterprise systems problems

68
00:4:31,000 --> 00:4:35,000  
by creating more tactical useful

69
00:4:35,000 --> 00:4:41,000  
forward-deployed systems debt eliminate outdated a redundant systems

70
00:4:41,000 --> 00:4:45,000  
but also takin a value of new emerging technologies

71
00:4:45,000 --> 00:4:49,000  
it's interesting when as a part of the twenty20

72
00:4:49,000 --> 00:4:54,000  
vision we decided to stand up the strategic innovation group it was

73
00:4:54,000 --> 00:4:56,000  
important to me as its first leader

74
00:4:56,000 --> 00:5:02,000  
that we be very focused on not just creating ideas

75
00:5:02,000 --> 00:5:05,000  
and innovations but in creating

76
00:5:05,000 --> 00:5:08,000  
in building business and specifically the business

77
00:5:08,000 --> 00:5:13,000  
the future the firm and a key part a bad

78
00:5:13,000 --> 00:5:18,000  
is our continued collaboration with our market in our account colleagues

79
00:5:18,000 --> 00:5:21,000  
when you think about the value of booze now on

80
00:5:21,000 --> 00:5:26,000  
our value has always been that we are major ext organization

81
00:5:26,000 --> 00:5:29,000  
that we develop and drive

82
00:5:29,000 --> 00:5:32,000  
the most exciting and emerging capabilities

83
00:5:32,000 --> 00:5:37,000  
across the institution into multiple accounts and markets

84
00:5:37,000 --> 00:5:42,000  
and sell their strategic innovation group is very focused on continuing to

85
00:5:42,000 --> 00:5:43,000  
do that

86
00:5:43,000 --> 00:5:47,000  
so when we talk about our innovation agenda that information age ended

87
00:5:47,000 --> 00:5:53,000  
is key and dependent upon working with our market America count colleagues who

88
00:5:53,000 --> 00:5:55,000  
understand the domains have defense

89
00:5:55,000 --> 00:5:59,000  
security commercial in this civil markets

89
00:5:59,000 --> 00:6:04,000  
far better than we do but we understand our capabilities we know the

90
00:6:04,000 --> 00:6:08,000  
technologies we know the ideas that were developing we know the problems were

91
00:6:08,000 --> 00:6:13,000  
trying to solve so that combination Inc lab racin between the

92
00:6:13,000 --> 00:6:17,000  
Innovation Group and the market group is key to our success

93
00:6:17,000 --> 00:6:23,000  
and key to building is future businesses

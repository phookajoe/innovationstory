0:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
the strategic innovation group is really structured

0:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in order to provide can create new value for our clients

0:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
some people say well what exactly do you mean by Matt when you think about

0:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
where we are at this point in history

0:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the budgets across all of government

0:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and even our commercial clients are declining operational budgets to perform

0:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
their mission

0:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
or to accomplish their business objectives and yet

0:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
when you think about it the requirements

0:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
the expectations and those missions and businesses have not changed

0:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
anyway and so our clients across the board are really looking for ways to

0:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
create new value

0:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
from ideas from innovations from new capabilities put together in new ways

0:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that's really what this strategic Innovation Group Inc who's now on

0:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
is focused on providing for our clients

0:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
by bringing capabilities and innovations together in new and unique ways

0:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
in some cases their old ideas put together in new ways

0:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
in some cases their new ideas but in

0:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
either dimension and we're looking at ways to bring those ideas to create

0:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
solutions that help our clients solve their most challenging problems

0:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and the reality years with less money to spend they need those product they need

0:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.005
those

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
problem solved in a more efficient way than ever before

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
so when you think about declining budgets and yet increasing expectation

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
for mission in business

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
there's a gap between what our clients can afford

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and what they need and we're calling Matt the value gap

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and from the value gap what we're trying to d

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
is create new solutions for our clients that are less expensive

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
access existing or new emerging take not technologies and combine them wit

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
existing capabilities to provide

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
better solutions than what they've had previously so hopefully we're creating

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
new value for our clients by doing that

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
our capabilities are combined in unique way

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
we have structured our innovation agenda very purposeful

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
along are clients most challenging and pressing problem

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
me give you an example in a few of those all of our client

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
are suffering from an inundation I have data

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
but they don't have to manage it they don't really know what data they have

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
they don't have stored and most importantly they don't have to get value

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
from I

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
SAR Bali from data initiative is specifically focused on developing

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Products and services for client

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
They can leverage their latent data across their institution

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
To better manage their institution or their firms other business

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
But most importantly also to generate value from that data

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
In it in no way of products and service

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
We’re also working on a big client problem around being able to predict

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Threats whether it's insider threats are global threat

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
To commercial businesses or to our government client

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
In in touch today

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
What we see is clients being able t

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
React to threats but not necessarily be able to predict

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
When and where and how they might occur

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Are foresight capabilities?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Global foresight cyber force I'd and insider foresight

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Are specific capabilities and solutions that we've tailored from our year’s o?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Working with the intelligence community

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
To help commercial clients and other government clients better predict where

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Those threats might happen

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Our clients across the board have massive

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Numbers systems many redundant many outdate

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Interfacing modernization challenges that are facing

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Inherent use challenges across they

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Organization as well a

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Issues with regard to their effectiveness in supporting the mission

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Our mission solutions initiative is focused

Vary purposefully on helping our clients solve their enterprise systems problem

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
By creating more tactical useful

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Forward-deployed systems debt eliminate outdated a redundant system

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
But also taken a value of new emerging technologies

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
It’s interesting when as a part of the twenty2

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Vision we decided to stand up the strategic innovation group it was

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Important to me as its first leader

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
That we be very focused on not just creating idea

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And innovations but in creating

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
In building business and specifically the business

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
The future the firm and a key part a be

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Is our continued collaboration with our market in our account colleague?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
When you think about the value of booze now o

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Our value has always been that we are major ext. organization

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
That we develop and drive

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
The most exciting and emerging capabilities

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Across the institution into multiple accounts and market

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And sell their strategic innovation group is very focused on continuing t

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Do that

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
So when we talk about our innovation agenda that information age ended

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Is key and dependent upon working with our market America count colleagues who

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Understand the domains have defense

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Security commercial in this civil market

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Far better than we do but we understand our capabilities we know the

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Technologies we know the ideas that were developing we know the problems were

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Trying to solve so that combination Inc. lab racing between the

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Innovation Group and the market group is key to our success

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000

0:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
the strategic innovation group is really structured

0:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in order to provide can create new value for our clients

0:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
smart people say well what exactly do you mean by Matt when you think about

0:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
where we are at this point in history

0:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the budgets across all of government

0:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and even our commercial clients are declining operational budgets to perform

0:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
their mission

0:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
or to accomplish their business objectives and yet

0:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
when you think about it the requirements

0:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
the expectations and those missions and businesses have not changed

0:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
anyway and so our clients across the board are really looking for ways to

0:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
create new value

0:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
from ideas from innovations from new capabilities put together in new ways

0:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that's really what this strategic Innovation Group Inc who's now on

0:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
is focused on providing for our clients

0:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
by bringing capabilities and innovations together in new and unique ways

0:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
in some cases their old ideas put together in new ways

0:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
in some cases their new ideas but in

0:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
either dimension and we're looking at ways to bring those ideas to create

0:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
solutions that help our clients solve their most challenging problems

0:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and the reality years with less money to spend they need those product they need

0:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.005
those

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
problem solved in a more efficient way than ever befor

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
so when you think about declining budgets and yet increasing expectation

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
for mission in busines

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
there's a gap between what our clients can affor

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and what they need and we're calling Matt the value ga

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and from the value gap what we're trying to d

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
is create new solutions for our clients that are less expensiv

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
access existing or new emerging take not technologies and combine them wit

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
existing capabilities to provid

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
better solutions than what they've had previously so hopefully we're creatin

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
new value for our clients by doing tha

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
our capabilities are combined in unique way

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
we have structured our innovation agenda very purposefull

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
along are clients most challenging and pressing problem

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
me give you an example in a few of those all of our client

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
are suffering from an inundation I have dat

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
but they don't have to manage it they don't really know what data they hav

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
they don't have stored and most importantly they don't have to get valu

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
from i

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
SAR Bali from data initiative is specifically focused on developin

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
products and services for client

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
they can leverage their latent data across their institutio

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
to better manage their institution or their firms other busines

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
but most importantly also to generate value from that dat

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
in it in no way of products and service

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
we're also working on a big client problem around being able to predic

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
threats whether it's insider threats are global threat

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
to commercial businesses or to our government client

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
in in touch toda

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
what we see is clients being able t

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
react to threats but not necessarily be able to predic

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
when and where and how they might occu

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
are foresight capabilitie

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
global foresight cyber force I'd and insider foresigh

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
are specific capabilities and solutions that we've tailored from our years o

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
working with the intelligence communit

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
to help commercial clients and other government clients better predict wher

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
those threats might happe

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
our clients across the board have massiv

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
numbers systems many redundant many outdate

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
interfacing modernization challenges that are facin

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
inherent use challenges across thei

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
organization as well a

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
issues with regard to their effectiveness in supporting the missio

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
our mission solutions initiative is focuse

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
vary purposefully on helping our clients solve their enterprise systems problem

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
by creating more tactical usefu

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
forward-deployed systems debt eliminate outdated a redundant system

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
but also takin a value of new emerging technologie

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
it's interesting when as a part of the twenty2

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
vision we decided to stand up the strategic innovation group it wa

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
important to me as its first leade

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
that we be very focused on not just creating idea

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and innovations but in creatin

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
in building business and specifically the busines

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
the future the firm and a key part a ba

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
is our continued collaboration with our market in our account colleague

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
when you think about the value of booze now o

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
our value has always been that we are major ext organizatio

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
that we develop and driv

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
the most exciting and emerging capabilitie

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
across the institution into multiple accounts and market

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and sell their strategic innovation group is very focused on continuing t

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
do tha

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
so when we talk about our innovation agenda that information age ende

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
is key and dependent upon working with our market America count colleagues wh

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
understand the domains have defens

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
security commercial in this civil market

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
far better than we do but we understand our capabilities we know th

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
technologies we know the ideas that were developing we know the problems wer

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
trying to solve so that combination Inc lab racin between th

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Innovation Group and the market group is key to our succes

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000

00:0:01.000 --> 00:0:04.000 A:middle T:50% the strategic innovation group is really structured
00:0:04.000 --> 00:0:08.000 A:middle T:50% in order to provide can create new value for our clients
00:0:08.000 --> 00:0:12.000 A:middle T:50% smart people say well what exactly do you mean by Matt when you think about
00:0:12.000 --> 00:0:12.000 A:middle T:50% where we are at this point in history
00:0:14.000 --> 00:0:18.000 A:middle T:50% the budgets across all of government
00:0:18.000 --> 00:0:18.000 A:middle T:50% and even our commercial clients are declining operational budgets to perform
00:0:22.000 --> 00:0:22.000 A:middle T:50% their mission
00:0:23.000 --> 00:0:27.000 A:middle T:50% or to accomplish their business objectives and yet
00:0:27.000 --> 00:0:30.000 A:middle T:50% when you think about it the requirements
00:0:30.000 --> 00:0:35.000 A:middle T:50% the expectations and those missions and businesses have not changed
00:0:35.000 --> 00:0:42.000 A:middle T:50% anyway and so our clients across the board are really looking for ways to
00:0:42.000 --> 00:0:44.000 A:middle T:50% create new value
00:0:44.000 --> 00:0:50.000 A:middle T:50% from ideas from innovations from new capabilities put together in new ways
00:0:50.000 --> 00:0:55.000 A:middle T:50% that's really what this strategic Innovation Group Inc who's now on
00:0:55.000 --> 00:0:58.000 A:middle T:50% is focused on providing for our clients
00:0:58.000 --> 00:1:04.000 A:middle T:50% by bringing capabilities and innovations together in new and unique ways
00:1:04.000 --> 00:1:09.000 A:middle T:50% in some cases their old ideas put together in new ways
00:1:09.000 --> 00:1:12.000 A:middle T:50% in some cases their new ideas but in
00:1:12.000 --> 00:1:12.000 A:middle T:50% either dimension and we're looking at ways to bring those ideas to create
00:1:17.000 --> 00:1:21.000 A:middle T:50% solutions that help our clients solve their most challenging problems
00:1:21.000 --> 00:1:26.000 A:middle T:50% and the reality years with less money to spend they need those product they need
00:1:26.000 --> 00:1:26.000 A:middle T:50% those
00:1:26.000 --> 00:1:32.000 A:middle T:50% problem solved in a more efficient way than ever before
00:1:32.000 --> 00:1:38.000 A:middle T:50% so when you think about declining budgets and yet increasing expectations
00:1:38.000 --> 00:1:39.000 A:middle T:50% for mission in business
00:1:39.000 --> 00:1:44.000 A:middle T:50% there's a gap between what our clients can afford
00:1:44.000 --> 00:1:48.000 A:middle T:50% and what they need and we're calling Matt the value gap
00:1:48.000 --> 00:1:51.000 A:middle T:50% and from the value gap what we're trying to do
00:1:51.000 --> 00:1:56.000 A:middle T:50% is create new solutions for our clients that are less expensive
00:1:56.000 --> 00:2:03.000 A:middle T:50% access existing or new emerging take not technologies and combine them with
00:2:03.000 --> 00:2:06.000 A:middle T:50% existing capabilities to provide
00:2:06.000 --> 00:2:10.000 A:middle T:50% better solutions than what they've had previously so hopefully we're creating
00:2:10.000 --> 00:2:14.000 A:middle T:50% new value for our clients by doing that
00:2:14.000 --> 00:2:19.000 A:middle T:50% our capabilities are combined in unique ways
00:2:19.000 --> 00:2:23.000 A:middle T:50% we have structured our innovation agenda very purposefully
00:2:23.000 --> 00:2:28.000 A:middle T:50% along are clients most challenging and pressing problems
00:2:28.000 --> 00:2:32.000 A:middle T:50% me give you an example in a few of those all of our clients
00:2:32.000 --> 00:2:36.000 A:middle T:50% are suffering from an inundation I have data
00:2:36.000 --> 00:2:40.000 A:middle T:50% but they don't have to manage it they don't really know what data they have
00:2:40.000 --> 00:2:44.000 A:middle T:50% they don't have stored and most importantly they don't have to get value
00:2:44.000 --> 00:2:45.000 A:middle T:50% from it
00:2:45.000 --> 00:2:50.000 A:middle T:50% SAR Bali from data initiative is specifically focused on developing
00:2:50.000 --> 00:2:52.000 A:middle T:50% products and services for clients
00:2:52.000 --> 00:2:56.000 A:middle T:50% they can leverage their latent data across their institution
00:2:56.000 --> 00:3:00.000 A:middle T:50% to better manage their institution or their firms other business
00:3:00.000 --> 00:3:03.000 A:middle T:50% but most importantly also to generate value from that data
00:3:03.000 --> 00:3:07.000 A:middle T:50% in it in no way of products and services
00:3:07.000 --> 00:3:12.000 A:middle T:50% we're also working on a big client problem around being able to predict
00:3:12.000 --> 00:3:16.000 A:middle T:50% threats whether it's insider threats are global threats
00:3:16.000 --> 00:3:19.000 A:middle T:50% to commercial businesses or to our government clients
00:3:19.000 --> 00:3:23.000 A:middle T:50% in in touch today
00:3:23.000 --> 00:3:28.000 A:middle T:50% what we see is clients being able to
00:3:28.000 --> 00:3:32.000 A:middle T:50% react to threats but not necessarily be able to predict
00:3:32.000 --> 00:3:35.000 A:middle T:50% when and where and how they might occur
00:3:35.000 --> 00:3:39.000 A:middle T:50% are foresight capabilities
00:3:39.000 --> 00:3:43.000 A:middle T:50% global foresight cyber force I'd and insider foresight
00:3:43.000 --> 00:3:49.000 A:middle T:50% are specific capabilities and solutions that we've tailored from our years of
00:3:49.000 --> 00:3:51.000 A:middle T:50% working with the intelligence community
00:3:51.000 --> 00:3:56.000 A:middle T:50% to help commercial clients and other government clients better predict where
00:3:56.000 --> 00:3:57.000 A:middle T:50% those threats might happen
00:3:57.000 --> 00:4:01.000 A:middle T:50% our clients across the board have massive
00:4:01.000 --> 00:4:06.000 A:middle T:50% numbers systems many redundant many outdated
00:4:06.000 --> 00:4:10.000 A:middle T:50% interfacing modernization challenges that are facing
00:4:10.000 --> 00:4:14.000 A:middle T:50% inherent use challenges across their
00:4:14.000 --> 00:4:17.000 A:middle T:50% organization as well as
00:4:17.000 --> 00:4:21.000 A:middle T:50% issues with regard to their effectiveness in supporting the mission

00:4:35.000 --> 00:4:41.000 A:middle T:50% forward-deployed systems debt eliminate outdated a redundant systems
00:4:41.000 --> 00:4:45.000 A:middle T:50% but also takin a value of new emerging technologies
00:4:45.000 --> 00:4:49.000 A:middle T:50% it's interesting when as a part of the twenty20
00:4:49.000 --> 00:4:54.000 A:middle T:50% vision we decided to stand up the strategic innovation group it was
00:4:54.000 --> 00:4:56.000 A:middle T:50% important to me as its first leader
00:4:56.000 --> 00:5:02.000 A:middle T:50% that we be very focused on not just creating ideas
00:5:02.000 --> 00:5:05.000 A:middle T:50% and innovations but in creating
00:5:05.000 --> 00:5:08.000 A:middle T:50% in building business and specifically the business
00:5:08.000 --> 00:5:13.000 A:middle T:50% the future the firm and a key part a bad
00:5:13.000 --> 00:5:18.000 A:middle T:50% is our continued collaboration with our market in our account colleagues
00:5:18.000 --> 00:5:21.000 A:middle T:50% when you think about the value of booze now on
00:5:21.000 --> 00:5:26.000 A:middle T:50% our value has always been that we are major ext organization
00:5:26.000 --> 00:5:29.000 A:middle T:50% that we develop and drive
00:5:29.000 --> 00:5:32.000 A:middle T:50% the most exciting and emerging capabilities

00:5:43.000 --> 00:5:47.000 A:middle T:50% so when we talk about our innovation agenda that information age ended
00:5:47.000 --> 00:5:53.000 A:middle T:50% is key and dependent upon working with our market America count colleagues who
00:5:53.000 --> 00:5:55.000 A:middle T:50% understand the domains have defense
00:5:55.000 --> 00:5:59.000 A:middle T:50% security commercial in this civil markets
00:5:59.000 --> 00:6:04.000 A:middle T:50% far better than we do but we understand our capabilities we know the
00:6:04.000 --> 00:6:08.000 A:middle T:50% technologies we know the ideas that were developing we know the problems were
00:6:08.000 --> 00:6:13.000 A:middle T:50% trying to solve so that combination Inc lab racin between the
00:6:13.000 --> 00:6:17.000 A:middle T:50% Innovation Group and the market group is key to our success
00:6:17.000 --> 00:6:23.000 A:middle T:50% and key to building is future businesses
